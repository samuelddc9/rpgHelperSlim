# rpgHelperSlim

During a RPG game session, the game master has to manage a big amount of information, keeping track of characters,enemies, their power, life points and other elements.  There are a number of available apps on google play and app store, but none of them provided a fluid and hassle-free experience, which is a crucial element, as interruptions break the flow of the game session. Aiming to fullfil this need, I decided to create my own, the RPG Helper, providing a practical touch-based, fluid user experience. You can read about the thought and app creation process at https://www.behance.net/gallery/38567945/RPG-Helper.
